# StaticStressTriggering

This contains the data for [enter publication]. Each file contains the decimal year, magnitude, location (latitude, longitude, and depth in km), strike, dip, and rake (in degrees) for each aftershock with the calculated stress tensor components (in Pa) associated with the preceding mainshock(s).

Interactive 3D plots for the aftershock sequences with associated Coulomb Failure Stress change are available [here](https://observablehq.com/@cehanagan/aftershock_stress).

The input files for RELAX 1.0.7 (Barbot and Fialko, 2010 [a,b]; Barbot, 2014) are also in this directory.
